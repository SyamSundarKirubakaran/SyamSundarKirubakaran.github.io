						<h2>Final Summary:</h2>
					</div>
					<h4>Student : <b>Syam Sundar K</b><br>
						Project : <b>Processing Language Server : Processing</b><br>
						Mentor : <b>Manindra K Moharana</b><br>
						Project Link : <a
							href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6526732054560768">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6526732054560768</a><br><br>
						Processing Language Server focuses on creating a <b>Language Server Protocol (LSP)</b>
						implementation for Processing Programming Language. PDE is currently built using Java and using
						custom components of the Swing Framework, which is ~ deprecated. The long term goal of
						Processing is to replace this with a JS based IDE to bring in more contributors and to make
						building UIs simple. While planning on building such IDE, LSP is of significant importance for
						any language that the IDE relays on. Since Processing is the targeted Programming language, itâ€™s
						quite important to build a Language Server Protocol for the same. This shall act as a benchmark
						for all the crucial activities of the IDE such as auto-completion, go-to-definition,
						hover-insights and so on. LSP will also help in easy and seamless integration of the above
						functionalities in any editor such as Atom, VScode, etc.
						<br><br>

						I started contibuting to Processing Foundation as a part of Google Summer of Code 2018, worked
						on creating an ARCore Renderer for Processing Android and this year I'm super excited to be a
						part
						of Processing Foundation again to work on Processing Language Server as a part of Google Summer
						of Code 2019.<br><br>
						This year was a lot different from the GSoC experience that I had last year. Last year, I worked
						on Android Mode for Processing and Android is something I'm so comfortable working with. But
						this
						year I made up my mind to work on something outside Android, something out of my comfort zone.
						Out of all the ideas in the GSoC 2019 idea list, Processing Language Server really caught my
						eyes. So I started digging deep into Language Server Concepts and Paradigms. Literally 20
						mins after exploring LSP, I felt, "this something that I can dedicate my summer for".
						<br>

						<h2>Feature List:</h2>
						<h4>
							Following are the list of deliverables by the end of GSoC 2019
							<ul>
								<li>Server Capabalities</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Auto Completion</li>
									<li>Diagnostics</li>
									<li>Hover for Insights</li>
									<li>Goto Definition</li>
									<li>Finding References</li>
									<li>Renaming / Refactoring</li>
								</ul>
								<li>VSCode Extension as a Language Client</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Community Bonding:</h2>
							<h4>
								Community bonding period was very helpful in getting me upto speed with coding. I had
								very little / no previous experience working with nodejs, so had to spend a lot of time
								learning the ins and outs of nodejs parallelly while exploring sample Language
								Servers that use LSP.<br><br>
								Spent good amount of time figuring out how stuff works in node and reading a lot of code
								before actually writing code. Also had to spend a good amount of time to get a strong
								grasp of AST[Abstract Syntax Tree] because it's the form in which results of parsing are
								obtained and most of the functional parts of the Language Server depends on Parsing and
								Compilation.<br>

								<h2>Coding Period:</h2>
								<h4>
									Initially, I started by creating a simple Language Server using nodejs and a
									Language Client that actively listens to the server. This was done by
									writing down a couple of config files and assigning ports through which they can communicate.<br><br>
									As Everyone knows, starting phase is always the hardest. Getting things in place, in
									the initial stage of the project was the challenging part of the entire coding
									period.
									But in a bit more than a 2 of weeks I was able to pickup speed and was able to keep
									up with the timeline promised in the Proposal.<br><br>
									I had to spend most of the time debugging in the initial stages of the coding period
									since AST in most cases is asymmentic so had to find most of the possible out comes of it to
									get a even more clear picture of the same. I would spend atleast an hour every day parsing
									and debugging preprocessed processing-java code to infer the patterns in AST and the way in which the
									parsed tokens are classified. Successive weeks were for implementing the entities of
									the feature list. <br><br>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Autocompletion</b> deals a lot with scoping of fields - had to classify
											the
											fields based on
											scopes and also had to import Processing Specific methods from the jar files
											to show as Autocompletion item.</li>
										<li><b>Diagnostics</b> mostly dealt with compilation - since Processing is a
											Domain
											Specific Language built on top of Java. It's required to preprocess the
											Processing Code into Java code before parsing it in the compilation phase,
											after compilation phase we'll get Error Nodes and the line number in which
											it has occured which will then be shown visually in the Language Client.
										</li>
										<li><b>Hover for Insights</b> dealt with extracting information for every
											Processing
											specific keyword from the Processing Documentation and displaying those info
											if the mouse pointer is hovered over any keyword for more than 2 secounds.
										</li>
										<li><b>Goto Definition</b> dealt will recording all the class, variable and
											method
											declarations with it's associated line number in a Tuple and redirecting to
											appropriate position in the workspace on cmd+click on any field.</li>
										<li><b>Finding References</b> will point to all possible usages of the any
											variable /
											method / class name - this is done by encapsulating workspace field
											positions with field names and displaying these encapsulated values on `Find References` invocation.</li>
										<li><b>Renaming / Refactoring</b> is an extension of Finding References where in
											renaming will modify
											the encapsulated field name in the Container & Mapper.</li>
									</ul>
									Overall, I really had fun learning and working with Compilers, Parser and Language
									Servers. Ofcourse, I ran into a number of road blocks and challenges along the way but
									finding ways to solve them is what made coding period great.!

											<ul>
												<li>Server side scripting with Nodejs</li>

												<li>Drafting Design Doc</li>
												<li>Design decisions</li>
												<li>Prioritizing Tasks</li>
											</ul>
											Many thanks to Manindra for his outstanding mentorship. In addition to
											helping me clear out all
											the road blocks I had, He taught me how to be a better software enginner
											over all. Things like
											organizing workflows and pipelining tasks, drafting and following design
											docs, classifying and
											prioritizing tasks are some of the crutial things that I learnt from him.
											It's been a great summer for me and looking forward to contribute more to
											Processing in the future. That's all for <b>GSoC'19</b>. Thanks for
											reading.!<br><br>
